{% set description = "The <code>nosuid</code> mount option specifies that the
<code>/dev/shm</code> (temporary filesystem stored in memory) will not execute <code>setuid</code> and
<code>setgid</code> on executable programs as such, but rather execute them with the uid and gid of the user executing the program." %}

{% set rationale = "Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them." %}
