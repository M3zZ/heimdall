{% set title = "Restrict Core Dumps" %}

{% set description = "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user." %}

{% set rationale = "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see
<code>limits.conf(5)</code> ). In addition, setting the
<code>fs.suid_dumpable</code> variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core." %}
