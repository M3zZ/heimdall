{% set description = "The
<code>/tmp</code> directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications." %}

{% set rationale = "Since the
<code>/tmp</code> directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making
<code>/tmp</code> its own file system allows an administrator to set the <code>noexec</code> option on the mount, making
<code>/tmp</code> useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system
<code>setuid</code> program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw." %}
