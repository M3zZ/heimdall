{% set title = "Disable Avahi Server" %}

{% set description = "Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine." %}

{% set rationale = "Since servers are not normally used for printing, this service is not needed unless dependencies require it. If this is the case, disable the service to reduce the potential attack surface." %}
