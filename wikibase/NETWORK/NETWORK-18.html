{% set title = "Install TCP Wrappers" %}

{% set description = "TCP Wrappers provides a simple access list and standardized logging method for services capable of supporting it. In the past, services that were called from
<code>inetd</code> and <code>xinetd</code> supported the use of tcp wrappers. As <code>inetd</code> and
<code>xinetd</code> have been falling in disuse, any service that can support tcp wrappers will have the <code>libwrap.so</code> library attached to it." %}

{% set rationale = "TCP Wrappers provide a good simple access list mechanism to services that may not have that support built in. It is recommended that all services that can support TCPWrappers, use it." %}
