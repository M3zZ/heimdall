{% set description = "The pam_pwquality module checks of the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the pam_pwquality.so options.
<pre><code>try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If not available, then prompt the user for a password. retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.</code></pre>
<pre><code>The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:
    minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more
    dcredit=-1 - provide at least 1 digit
    ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character
    ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character
    lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character</code></pre>
The setting shown above is one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies." %}
