{% set rationale = "SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity.
<code>DEBUG</code> is specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.
<code>INFO</code> level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field." %}
