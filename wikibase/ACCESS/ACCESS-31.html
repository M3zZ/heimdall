{% set title = "Restrict Access to the su Command" %}

{% set description = "The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo , which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in
<code>/etc/pam.d/su</code>, the su command will only allow users in the wheel group to execute su." %}

{% set rationale = "Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program." %}
