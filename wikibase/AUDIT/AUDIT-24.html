{% set description = "The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageable large. The file
<code>/etc/logrotate.d/syslog</code> is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by
<code>syslog</code> or
<code>rsyslog</code>s. These files are rotated on a weekly basis via a cron job and the last 4 weeks are kept." %}
